A 3D shm'up combining *Ikaruga* with *Geometry Wars 3*. Absorb like-colored lasers, and shoot down other ships on a spherical planet.

Created for [Ludum Dare 47](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/what-goes-around).

**Controls:**

* Arrow keys or WASD to move.
* Mouse to aim (the laser auto-fires).
* Tap the Space bar or right-Ctrl to toggle your ship color.

Like *Ikaruga*, your ship can absorb like-colored lasers, while enemies are weak against opposite colored lasers. Note that running into other ships, regardless of color, will still  hurt your ship.
